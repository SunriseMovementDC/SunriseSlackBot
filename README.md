Sunrisers need to know who to ask about stuff (e.g. if I want to know what's going on with Rent Control, I need to go talk to Sam).

Mike's suggestion is to ask Sunrisers to set their Slack status to their role with a prefix (e.g. `> Ops Lead`), then programmatically generate an org chart.

Kevin also suggested generating org charts from Slack user groups. That might come in handy later.
